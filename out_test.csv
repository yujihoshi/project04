Hubble is a technology startup focused on revolutionising the Construction Industry. The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in.
There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none.
Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals:
1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total.
2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today.
3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean.
4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value.
Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction.
We have also built the best engineering, product, and business team comprising the best and brightest of Singapore. We are a collegial set up and are extremely collaborative. We are hiring aggressively and are looking for motivated, smart, driven, and resourceful people to join our team.
Who are we looking for:
Hubble has entered into a 12 - 18 months partnership with 2 leading Data Companies who are experts in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence - BoostML (see attached BoostML_Intro.pdf) and A*Star (see here) to help build up Hubble’s data infrastructure and strategy. BoostML will station 3 senior data scientists and engineers at Hubble full time over 18 months. We are looking for a talented Junior Data Scientist/Engineer who is passionate about this space and looking to learn the tools of the trade from the best in the business. You will be learning from BoostML and A*Star to build up Hubble’s data capabilities and take full ownership and leadership of this vertical at the end of 18 months after BoostML and A*Star completes the build up phase. This is an exciting and challenging role and our bet is on you. We want to groom and train you to become the future leaders in Hubble (see What Hubble will give you section).
Your current mood:
You want to be a data scientist but lack the ‘right’ paper qualifications for the job. You feel that you have talents in abundance but they are not recognised because of ‘paper qualifications’. You want to make an impact at work and make a dent in the universe. You want to be in a dynamic, fun, and energetic environment. You also want to be mentored by the best data scientists and engineers in Asia and aspire to take on leadership role in a fast growing startup. You want to step up to the plate now. You want to bat for home run and help build up the data capability of a fast growing company - Hubble.
What Hubble will give you:
Hubble is built by a team of talented, driven, and ambitious individuals. We do not subscribe to conventions. We do not let history and traditions dictate and limit our dreams to shape the world. We adopt the same mindset with our hiring. We are looking for the best and we want to bet on you. In this position, we will give you all the exposure and resources you need to eventually grow into the role of Head of Data. If you mindset is right, we promise you the ride of your life.
Who will you be working with:
If you connect with any of the description below, please apply immediately:
Purpose driven
Hungry, ambitions, and self-motivated
Meritocratic, results/performance > age/bureaucracy
Resourceful, independent, chart our own destiny
Determined, perseverance, and hard working
Creative, innovative, out of the box
Yes, the above is everyone of us at Hubble.

Trained under BoostML and A*Star and to be main coordinator
To be the overall in-charge with data related matters at Hubble 
Processing data pipelines.
Build and maintain data mart and data warehouse.
Development of Machine Learning apps
Development of resource optimisation algorithms such as automated deployment algorithms for 4M"	"What skill sets do you need:

operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.
Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our
proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the
process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach).
Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the
option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points),
make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic,
